                Earth is dying because of us. However, earth may also recover if we do our part to save it. There are
                many things we can do.
                Here are some of my personal goals to save Earth.

                    Reduce Food Wastage
                </div>
                <p>
                    Reducing food wastage is a very underrated way of saving earth and thus, only very few people
                    actually reduce food wastage.
                    I myself frequently waste food not only because I can't finish my food, but also because I do not
                    eat the vegetables.
                    I am sure there are also many like me.
                    This can cause our landfill to be full and Singapore would not have a place to throw away its
                    rubbish.
                    Therefore, my goal here is to order less and ask the cooks to not add in vegetables.

                    Use Reusable Alternatives
                </div>
                <p>
                    Disposable plastic items are being used due to its convenience, but can't we sacrifice a bit of
                    convenience just to save the planet we live in?
                    I am glad to see many people using reusable bags and containers when they go shopping or when they
                    order food.
                    Shops are also charging money for any requests for plastic bags. For example, the 7-Eleven at Dover
                    MRT charges 10 cents for plastic bags.
                    I am very motivated by this move and I also want to bring containers whenever I order food outside.

                    Plant Trees
                </div>
                <p>
                    Trees are being cut/burnt down every day to make land for agriculture, as well as for manufacturing
                    of wooden furniture.
                    How am I going to plant trees? Well, there are organisations that accept donations so that they can
                    plant trees under my name.
                    For example, The organisation, Team Trees, plants 1 tree for every dollar a person donates.
                    Team Trees have partnered up with many content creators like Mr Beast to spread awareness about
                    their organisation.
                    That is how I have gotten to know about it. My goal here is to donate USD$10 every month so that 10
                    trees will be planted under my name.
